# ACTION CHESS!

think regular chess, but each piece has a "cool down" and its not turn based. i,e, you can move as many pieecs as you want as fast as you want (as long as they are not on cooldown, so you can move for instance one specific pawn every 3s)

you can move your queen every 30s or something
so the faster you can play the better, if you can manage your resources
also there should be some sort of mana-system where each move costs mana that refills every x seconds
ACTION CHESS!

you can use mana to power up certain pieces and give them ultimates

you can draw special abilities from a deck like time warp (rewind the state of a 3x3 sub-grid 5 seconds) or cloak (all units inside a 3x3 sub grid become invisible for 5 seconds)
